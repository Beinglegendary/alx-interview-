## Data Structures
Explore a wide range of fundamental data structures, including:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Hash Tables
- And more!

Each data structure comes with a set of problems and solutions to help you grasp their practical applications and strengthen your problem-solving skills.

## Algorithms
Dive into various algorithms such as:
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Dynamic programming
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Greedy algorithms
- And more!

Detailed explanations and Python implementations are provided to guide you through the intricacies of these algorithms and their usage in interview scenarios.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute new problems, solutions, or improvements to the project, please follow the guidelines outlined in our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
